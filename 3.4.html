                Henry Edmunds, a shareholder in Royce’s company and a friend of Rolls, was boasting to him about his new 10hp Royce motor car. At the time, Rolls was frustrated at only being able to sell foreign imports, so Edmunds arranged a meeting with the man behind the 10hp.

Little did Edmunds know that the meeting he organised would change the future of motoring forever.

Rolls and Royce first met on 4 May 1904 in Manchester. Within minutes of seeing Royce’s twin-cylinder 10hp, Rolls knew he had found what he was looking for. After taking the motor car for a drive, Rolls agreed on the spot to sell as many motor cars as Royce could build, under the name Rolls-Royce.

Creating a brand requires vision. So while Rolls and Royce were busy building and selling motor cars, it was Rolls’ partner, Claude Johnson, who stepped into the role of Managing Director and expanded the fledgling company’s reputation. A genius at publicity, Claude Johnson was so integral to the success of the company that he became known as ‘the hyphen in Rolls-Royce’.One of Johnson’s early adverts for the 40/50hp motor car promoted it as: ‘The six-cylinder Rolls-Royce – not one of the best, but the Best Car in the World.’ In that moment, he had introduced the phrase that would forever be associated with Rolls-Royce.

Johnson’s decision to orchestrate a series of publicity stunts to promote the quietness and reliability of Rolls-Royce motor cars was incredibly effective. It demonstrated their superior performance and created global exposure for their world-class engineering. The rest is history.

                    And Charles Robinson Sykes, a bohemian artist and sculptor. His friendship with the maverick group led to his creating the ‘Spirit of Ecstasy’ – an emblem that has stood as an internationally-recognised symbol of perfection ever since.
                    Theirs was a band whose thirst for experience made the London’s elite appear timid in comparison. And at its magnetic core was Eleanor… </td>
